# SoftWing
Soft input controller for the LG Wing. 
Since LG hasn't made a native keyboard that operates on the second screen, I went ahead and made my own. In addition to a virtual gamepad, SoftWing also provides the ability to set custom swivel open/closed sounds via the "Sound Settings" menu.

Stable builds of SoftWing are now available on the Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jodonlucas.softwing&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1
Additionally, I have some legacy builds available in this repository.

For instructions on how to setup and use SoftWing, please see the help instructions in the app (Controller Settings -> Help).
