# SoftWing
Soft input controller for the LG Wing. 
Since LG hasn't made a native keyboard that operates on the second screen, I went ahead and made my own.
So far, I've had a lot of trouble trying to show the controller on the second display without requiring root permissions.
However, I was able to make a controller that could piggyback on the LG keyboard to show up on the second screen.

## Setup
1. Make sure "Show Icon For Switching Keyboards" is enabled in your device settings.
2. Enable the "Soft Wing Input" keyboard under "Manage Keyboards".
3. Set your default keyboard to "Soft Wing Input".

## Use
1. Start with the wing closed.
2. Select any text box on the main display (This gives the keyboard an initial connection token and posts the notification used to open the input method).
3. A silent SoftWing notification should appear, this is what you will use to open the controller later.
4. Open the game you want to play.
5. Tap the SoftWing notification to open the controller on the main display. (Note, if this does not open the controller go back to step 2)
6. Swivel open the LG Wing, if the process was successful you should see the LG keyboard open on the second display.
7. Tap the keyboard switching icon in the bottom right corner of the LG keyboard.
8. Select the Soft Wing Input from the menu. (Note, if the controller does not appear, close your wing and return to step 5)
